# String theory

## Story

Otto Reinier, the eccentric billionaire has a strange hobby:
[recreational linguistics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logology_(linguistics)>).
He loves to play around with words and is eager to find patterns in
texts. He hires you to write a library that can help him in his
research. And... well, he pays a lot, so you decide to deal with
anagrams and stuff for a while. See the grammatical definitions
below at "Hints".

## What are you going to learn?

You will practice string operations and improve your algorithmic skills.

## Tasks

1. Implement the `is_palindrome` function that checks whether a given input string is palindrome or not. Check the letters only, upper/lower case, whitespace, punctuation does not matter.
    - For palindrome input strings the return value is `True`, otherwise `False`.
    - The checker skips everything but the letters.
    - The checker is insensitive to letter case.

2. Implement the `is_isogram` function that checks whether a given input string is isogram or not. Check the letters only, upper/lower case, whitespace, punctuation does not matter.
    - For isogram input strings the return value is `True`, otherwise `False`.
    - The checker skips everything but the letters.
    - The checker is insensitive to letter case.

3. Implement the `is_pangram` function that checks whether a given input string is pangram or not. Check the letters only, upper/lower case, whitespace, punctuation does not matter.
    - For pangram input strings the return value is `True`, otherwise `False`.
    - The checker skips everything but the letters.
    - The checker is insensitive to letter case.

4. Implement the `is_anagram` function that checks whether two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. Check the letters only, upper/lower case, whitespace, punctuation does not matter.
    - For anagrammatic input strings the return value is `True`, otherwise `False`.
    - The checker skips everything but the letters.
    - The checker is insensitive to letter case.

5. [OPTIONAL] Implement the `is_blanagram` function that checks whether two given strings are blanagrams of each other or not. Check the letters only, upper/lower case, whitespace, punctuation does not matter.
    - For blanagrammatic input strings the return value is `True`, otherwise `False`.
    - The checker skips everything but the letters.
    - The checker is insensitive to letter case.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- A _palindrome_ is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of
  characters which reads the same backward as forward, e.g. "rotator",
  "Anna", "My gym". See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome>.
- An _isogram_ (or _heterogram_) is a word or phrase without a repeating
  letter, e.g. "cornflakes", "subdermatoglyphic". See
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram>.
- A _pangram_ is a sentence or other sequence of characters in which
  every letter of the alphabet is used at least once, e.g. "Sphinx of
  black quartz, judge my vow". See
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram>.
- An _anagram_ is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of
  a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly
  once, e.g. "fairy tales" for "rail safety" or "eleven plus two" for
  "twelve plus one". See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram>.
- A _blanagram_ (from blank+anagram) is a word which is an anagram of
  another but for the substitution of a single letter, e.g. "chipotle"
  for "poetical" (anagrams after replacing "a" for "h"). See
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanagram>.
